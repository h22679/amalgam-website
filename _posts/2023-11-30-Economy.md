We use both [Diamond Economy](https://modrinth.com/mod/diamond-economy) and [Diamond Chest Shops](https://modrinth.com/mod/diamond-chest-shops). Here's a quick guide to help you navigate our diamond-based economy and set up your own shop to start trading.

## Understanding the Diamond Economy

In this server, diamonds are more than shiny rocks; they are the backbone of economy. With the `/diamonds` command, you can manage your precious stones and turn your hard-earned loot into purchasing power.

*"What if I'm not interested in trading?"*<br>
 Well, you can sill deposit diamonds in your balance to move up in the top balance ranking and show off ;)

### Getting Started with Diamonds

- **Deposit Diamonds**: Securely store your diamonds using `/diamonds deposit`. Just hold the diamonds in your main hand and they'll be added to your balance.
- **Withdraw Diamonds**: Need physical diamonds? Use `/diamonds withdraw` to convert your balance into items.
- **Sending Diamonds**: Want to pay a friend? `/diamonds send` lets you transfer diamonds to another player's balance.
- **Checking Your Wealth**: Curious about your financial standing? `/diamonds balance` reveals your current balance, and `/diamonds top` shows the wealthiest players on the server.

## Setting Up Your Shop

Ready to jump into the world of commerce? Setting up a shop is straightforward with Diamon Chest Shops.

    - Place a chest or a barrel and add a sign on it.
    - On this sign write either `BUY` or `SELL` on the first line
    - Write the quantity of items you want to sell on the second line.
    - And lastly the price on the third line.
